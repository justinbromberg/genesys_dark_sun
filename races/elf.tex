{Tharak, human guard}

Athasʹ deserts, plains, steppes and badlands are home
to the elves, a long–limbed race of trading, raiding,
thieving sprinters. Running is the key to acceptance and
respect among elves. Elves that are injured and cannot
run are often left behind to die.\\

\textbf{Personality:} Other races see elves as dishonest and
lazy; generally a fair assessment. Elves idle around their
time for days until compelled by need to exert themselves,
but they can run for days without complaint. No self–
respecting elf will consent to ride an animal. To do so is
dishonorable; Elven custom dictates that individuals keep
up or be left behind. Elves prefer to lead short, happy
lives rather than long, boring ones. Seeing the future as a
dark, deadly place, they prefer to live in "the now,"
enjoying each fleeting moment. They thrive in open
spaces, and tend to wither in captivity.\\
