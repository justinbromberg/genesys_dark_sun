\subsection{Arcane}
Arcana is a skill. The Mage Specialisation grants Arcana as a class skill and cantrips. Furthermore its talents unlocks higher level spells. Casting a spell
requires a roll and will always result in atleast 2 strain, in addition to any other negative effect gained from rolling \threat or \despair. All arcane
casters have the option of defiling, which can be used to ignore all strain and wounds gained from casting the spell, but which will cause 3 damage to a
nearby living creature and grants the GM an \dark.
