\section{Dice}

Roll \difficulty\difficulty and upgrade twice. Add \boost or \setback\setback.
Difficult checks may require the use of \challenge, but you may compensate for
this using your \ability\ability or even \proficiency. The \force die is
probably the rarest.

\section{Symbols}

Eveyone likes \success and while \advantage is better, \triumph is the best
thing you can roll. If you're unfortunate, you might roll \failure, \threat or
even \despair! Force dice can roll \light, \dark and \darklight. These symbols
are roughly exported using Inkscape and can be improved upon to make them look
nicer.
