\epigraph{\textit{"The worst thing you can say to a dwarf is 'It can’t be done.'
If he’s already decided to do it, he may never speak to you again. If he hasn’t
decided to take up the task, he may commit himself to it simply out of spite.
‘Impossible’ is not a concept most dwarves understand. Anything can be done,
with enough determination."} }{Sha’len, Nibenese trader}

Dwarves form a good part of the people encountered in the Tablelands. These
strong and devoted beings live to fulfill their focus, a task they choose
to devote their lives to. Stubborn and strong‐minded, dwarves make good
companions, even though their usual focused nature can tend to be bothersome.\\

\textbf{Personality:} Dwarves prefer to occupy themselves with meaningful tasks,
and often approach these tasks with an intensity rarely seen in other races.
As such, dwarves make excellent laborers, and take great pride in their
accomplishments. However, their stubbornness can lead to difficulties.
Dwarves will sometimes fail to listen to reason, attempting to accomplish what
are impossible tasks. Dwarves live for their focus. Dwarves that die while
being unable to complete their focus return from the dead as banshees to
haunt their unfinished work. A dwarf also rarely divulges his focus to anyone.\\
